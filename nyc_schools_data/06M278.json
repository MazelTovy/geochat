      "Our PS/MS 278 community is dedicated to the success of all students.  While we offer a rigorous academic curriculum culminating in 8th grade Algebra Regents, we prioritize a whole child approach to learning where students are provided with a learning environment and experiences to thrive academically, social-emotionally, and physically. Our instructors utilize a School Wide Enrichment Model (SEM) Program and offer a variety of activities which include a visual arts, music, and STEM curriculum, Career Day, Science & Robotics Fairs, and celebrations via concerts and classroom displays. Additional academic supports are provided after school such as our After School, Holiday Break, and Saturday Academies and Junior High School Art Portfolio Program.  Our school enjoys partnerships with multiple organizations including a school-based mental health clinic and prevention team through Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital,  92nd St. Y Music and Dance; CHAMPS and PSAL after school sports (Basketball, Volleyball, Softball, Cheerleading, etc.) and Track & Field program at the Armory, ICS/Compass, Center for Arts Education; Creative Arts Work; and the Situation Project where middle school students attend two Broadway shows a year.  We offer an early drop-off breakfast program at 7": "30 am and after-school programs Monday-Friday for students in all grades.  NYC Public Schools has proposed to relocate the school to a new building, M502 located at 3761 10th Avenue New York NY 10034, pending approval by the Panel for Educational Policy."
