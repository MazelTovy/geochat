    "The Academy of Public Relations is a Community in the South Bronx where self-esteem is fostered through Articulate and Thoughtful Communication, Public Speaking, and Reflection. At APR learning is a real world experience where teachers care beyond learning and students develop a purpose. Teachers will create culturally relevant student centered active learning experiences with real world connections, which will lead to more student engagement as well as an increase of academic discourse.  Furthermore, teacher's lessons will include higher order questioning techniques which will lead to greater student led discussions along with continuous assessment throughout the lesson to inform feedback and next steps. Priorities include creating and maintaining an inclusive environment for all students, focusing on Core Beliefs about how students learn best and all students learn in different ways,  improving student attendance, improving teacher effectiveness, improving student achievement through identified standards and increasing parental involvement. APR offers grade specific advisory which incorporates Restorative Practice approaches and culturally relevant issues. Sports and afterschool programs have great variety to include all students.",
