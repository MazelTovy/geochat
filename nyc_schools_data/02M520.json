    "The mission of Murry Bergtraum (MBHS) is to equip our students with the skills and knowledge to enter and succeed in post-secondary institutions. The Ninth Grade Academy provides the academic support, skills, and resources in a small nurturing environment needed for students to graduate in four years. As students progress, internships and mentoring opportunities support our academic goals with real-world experiences. The Blazer Early College Preparatory Academy, a STEM program, emphasizes analytical and critical-thinking skills through an early reinforcement of college learning across a rigorous curriculum. Relationships established with our corporate and academic partners are at the foundation of our program.",
