    "Our school offers an amazing opportunity for learning. Compared to other public schools, PS 347 classes are relatively small. That means that every individual gets the opportunity to shine. We are a community of learners with many backgrounds and cultures. Our pre-k through 5th grade student population is mostly comprised of  CODAs (Children of Deaf Parents), Hearing students, Deaf children, students who are hard-of-hearing, children related to Deaf people, and/or allies of the community. Many of our incoming middle schoolers are hearing and have no Deaf affiliation. We welcome everyone! The mission of PS 347 is to provide a joyful learning environment that celebrates the education, growth and difference of each and every student. All students are offered the opportunity to learn ASL and most become proficient! Our high-achieving 8th graders are given the opportunity to take Algebra 1 and start HS having earned 9th grade credit. All of our teachers support everyone with an engaging and rigorous curriculum to provide children the opportunity to achieve their personal best. Our staff is committed to inspiring and encouraging curiosity, empathy, and social awareness by developing higher-level thinking skills and exploring real world issues that extend into the community. By fostering a partnership with families, we can support individual student goals to enable each child to become an independent and responsible life-long learner, preparing for success in the journey to higher education. ALL SIGNS POINT TO SUCCESS!",
