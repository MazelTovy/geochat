    "Directory-overview": {
      "The mission of the Special Music School is to teach musically gifted children through highly structured instrumental training and a standards-based academic program. The school prepares students for professional music careers while recognizing that not every student will choose such a career. The underlying philosophy of the Special Music School is the belief that music education for gifted pupils requires": "1) extensive opportunities to work one-to-one with an outstanding instrumental faculty; 2) a structured, sequential music curriculum; 3) opportunities to perform before audiences; and 4) interaction between general academics and musical studies. Our goal is to see each child reach his or her academic and musical potential. Our vision is that all students will become lifelong learners and critical thinkers in our caring and respectful learning environment. We encourage parental involvement in all aspects of the school."
