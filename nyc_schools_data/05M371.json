    "M.S. 371 opened its doors in the Fall of 2020. M.S. 371 aims to rethink the middle school experience by immersing students in active exploration of their world. Through project-based learning, outdoor experiences, and hands-on approaches, students will be challenged to question their world and dig deep to find answers. By pairing this work with a strong math, literacy, and arts foundation, students will be encouraged to share their ideas with an authentic audience beyond the classroom walls and take action in their communities. We seek to root student learning in a deep understanding of the earth??s systems and societies.",
