      "TMA serves grades 6-12 with a specific purpose of preparing students for college or to move directly into a variety of career and training programs. As a school of approximately 500 students, we are able to know and support our students in this small community. We have established over twenty community partnerships that range from technology and design to street squash. Students are expected to participate in college courses through our partnerships with different colleges and universities during the 10th and 11th grade. We offer mentoring programs dedicated to both young women and men. Our sports include female and male basketball teams, track and badminton. Our grades 6 - 8 program includes wrap-around supports with our extended learning time partner SoBro (programs run from 3": "05 pm - 6 pm Monday's through Fridays) free of charge."
