    "Central Park East II (CPE II) is a collaborative community where staff, parents, and students work together to create a safe, caring, academically rigorous, and joyful school environment. CPE II provides an enriched education to all students that includes the arts, both visual and performing, and sports, including basketball and soccer. We have a state of the art library, a dance studio and a two-level hydroponics garden. Just a few steps from the footbridge, we use Randall's Island as an outdoor classroom. As a Community School in partnership with Children's Aid, we are able to provide many extra programs and services, including a full after-school and summer program. We participate in a variety of programs such as Urban Advantage and Civics for All. We give students the critical thinking skills, understandings, and habits of mind that will help them become thoughtful readers, writers, mathematicians, scientists, and keen observers of the world, as well as ethical agents for change. We want our students to know that their voice is important and they can use it to advocate for themselves and others to make a difference in the world.",
