    "The mission of Dual Language Middle School (DLMS) is to support a dual language instructional model which promotes academic excellence and is built upon student strengths and curiosities. We believe that students who love languages can learn best through the dual language structure. Students are encouraged to question, challenge, make real decisions, and work collaboratively to solve problems. Through a rigorous project-directed, theme-based curriculum, children learn that school is a place to develop respect for self and others. Our mission is founded on the premise that we must experience an atmosphere of trust, safety, security, and personal attention in order to develop emotional and intellectual growth.   At DLMS, each student is assigned an advisor to help them and their families navigate the middle school experiences. Our students take overnight trips to Camp Manice, visit universities like New York University and Fordham, and have mentors from Salesforce and the National Basketball Association to support their growth and development. In addition to core academic classes, all students take 3 years of Spanish, Visual Arts, Physical Education and Dance, with at least two public dance performances per year.  Bienvenidos a DLMS!",
