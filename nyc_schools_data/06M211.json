    "Inwood Early College (IEC) is a career and technical education learning community. We are an Early College school partnered with Bronx Community College (BCC) where students have access to earn course credits towards an associate degree, if eligible, at no cost to their family.   Through mastery based learning and work- based learning, students prepare for technical industry certifications in either computer information systems or computer science while earning a regents diploma.    Potentially upon completion of their studies at IEC, students can continue their education with BCC- or continue their education through alternative programs such as ASAP working towards a degree in Cyber Security or Health Sciences.  These majors will prepare them for deciding to move directly into the job market or continue their education through their Bachelor's degree level and beyond.  We are also part of the Career Readiness and Modern Youth Apprenticeship ( CRMYA) pilot, which supports career readiness for all students. We have courses that support our 9th & 10th grade students in exploring their career interests and develop work readiness skills. All students apply for internships and apprenticeships with NY Presbyterian Hospital and Inwood Community Services with interest in technology, finance, business and health professionals. We are part of the Career Readiness and Modern Youth Apprenticeship (CRMYA) pilot, which helps us support career readiness for all our students. We have courses that help our ninth and tenth graders explore their career interests and develop readiness skills. Our students can apply for apprenticeships in tech, finance, and business, which allows them to earn and learn while in high school.",
