      "Our mission is to be a caring community of lifelong learners, with collaborative teaching in a workshop model where you the students are doing most of the talking and heavy lifting of your own learning. Teachers are facilitators and coaches. Our student-centered, pedagogical focus and instructional program is unique and grounded in the philosophy of a \"community of learners.\"  We believe that all children are gifted in multiple ways": "Children learn by doing Children learn at different rates, using different strengths and different learning styles Children learn about the world in an integrated way Children learn when they feel good about themselves Children learn when their families are active participants in their school Students engage daily in challenging work that requires you to think, reflect and problem solve. We value questioning that leads to discussion, as well as routines that provide all students access to the curricula, extends your higher order thinking skills, and promotes rigor and ownership of their learning. Your teachers and I look forward to this school year which promises to be an exciting, enriching and full of learning."
