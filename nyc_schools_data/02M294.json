    "At Essex Street Academy, students learn to be critical, creative thinkers in a diverse and supportive school community. Graduates demonstrate mastery of skills and content in each discipline by completing in-depth, inquiry-based projects. Through small classes and advisories, teachers get to know their students as individuals while nurturing their intellectual curiosity and emotional development. Students are encouraged to explore opportunities outside the classroom through partnerships with local universities, professional internships, international study, and outdoor leadership programs; and to become active members of their community both inside and outside of school.",
