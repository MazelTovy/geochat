    "Ballet Tech, The NYC Public School for Dance, provides students in grades 4-8 with a high quality academic education and rigorous classical dance training. The school is a unique partnership between the NYC Department of Education and Ballet Tech Foundation, which provides dance instruction. At Ballet Tech, we believe that students learn best in a supportive and positive environment that encourages discussion and requires critical thinking. Ballet Tech's middle school builds on the academic foundation established in its elementary school, raising the level of intellectual rigor while also addressing the social and emotional needs unique to middle school students.   Middle school students take dance classes 5 days a week. The core middle school dance curriculum includes classes in ballet technique, pointe, allegro, and modern. In addition, students take supporting dance classes such as audition prep, composition, jazz, and tap.   \"Kids Dance,\" Ballet Tech's student performance troupe, provides students with the opportunity to learn choreography and develop performance skills. Kids Dance performs annually at The Joyce Theater in Chelsea, where it presents programs for families and young audiences.",
