      "Located in Chelsea, our community embodies our core values of collaboration, compassion, academic rigor, and diversity and pluralism. Our Labbies put the \"lab\" in collaborative! Our academically nurturing and rigorous environment fosters curiosity and lifelong learning. Students engage in inquiry across all disciplines. In humanities classes, we combine social studies and ELA and offer enrichment courses on unique topics. To enhance our core curriculum, we provide Regents math and science courses for students ready for the challenge. Students also participate in national competitions (math, writing, and vocabulary) and work with local arts organizations. We are proud of our inclusion program and offer supports so all students succeed": "full- and part-time ICT classes, small group specialized instruction, executive functioning support, and all related services. Across the three years, all students take typing, transitions to middle school, coding, advisory, visual art, and drama. Our PA works tirelessly to supplement students' experiences and organize family events such as a Lunar New Year celebration. Former Labbies report back that teachers' high expectations and three years of Spanish have prepared them well for high school.  Priority to applicants eligible for Free or Reduced Lunch (FRL) for 36% of seats."
