    "MS324 is a school where students and their families are supported in achieving academic and socio-emotional success. Principal Carlos Guzman was raised just four blocks from Patria Mirabal and is very much aware of the challenges that students face on a daily basis. This separates Patria from many of the other schools as their leader is a product of the environment and has his heart set on making Patria a school where all students feel valued, safe and all of their academic needs are met. Patria Mirabal has a staff that goes above and beyond for their students. Teachers are extremely dedicated, professional and competent in their craft. Teachers do not leave Patria Mirabal and it is a place where they would send their own children. Patria Mirabal offers a variety of programs before and after school for students. Programs include Art, Music, Stem, Theatre and many more. Academically, students have the opportunity to graduate with High School credits in Living Environment and Algebra I, and many students are accepted into the specialized High Schools around the city. Using restorative practices and approaches, our staff is equipped to provide a wealth of emotional support for our students no matter what they are experiencing.",
