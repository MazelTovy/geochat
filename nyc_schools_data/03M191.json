    "We at RSMA are thrilled to announce that we are in our candidacy to become an accredited International Baccalaureate (IB) school. Our commitment to the IB program, particularly the Middle Years Program (MYP), reflects our dedication to providing a comprehensive and internationally recognized education. The MYP emphasizes intellectual challenge and encourages students to make connections between their studies and the real world. In addition to our core academic classes, we offer a rich array of courses in music, theater, visual arts, design and engineering, and world languages. These offerings reflect our belief in a well-rounded education that nurtures not only the intellect but also the creative spirit of our students. As part of our accelerated math program, all of our students take the Algebra I regents course. We also offer the Biology regents course, ensuring our students receive a solid foundation in the sciences. Beyond the classroom, we provide extensive after-school activities. We offer a free DYCD comprehensive after-school program and an athletics program that includes fall, winter, and spring sports teams. These programs aim to foster teamwork, discipline, and physical fitness among our students. We also provide extensive in-school enrichment activities. These include conservatory-style music and visual arts offerings, hip-hop dance, eSports, digital music creation, videography, and intramural sports. These activities provide our students with opportunities to explore their passions, develop new skills, and express their creativity. At RSMA, we strive to provide an enriching, balanced, and inclusive educational experience for all our students.",
