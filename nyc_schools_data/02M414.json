      "We offer a unique program that uses the city's museums and cultural institutions to enrich our curricula. Our current partners are the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney, Japan Society, Schomburg Center, and Hudson River Community Sailing, who each become extensions of our classrooms, affording students the hands-on experience needed to make learning deep, challenging, and engaging. Classroom instruction draws upon learning that takes place in the field, and deepens it with content that compels questioning, reflection, and insight. In addition to our regular course sequences we offer 12 Advanced Placement courses and 3 world languages. We are an AP Capstone school. Upon graduation our students are well prepared to enter an excellent 4 year college or university.    Diversity in Admissions (DIA)": "Priority to applicants eligible for free or reduced price lunch for 50% of seats."
