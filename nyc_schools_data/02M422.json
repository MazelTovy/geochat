    "Quest to Learn teachers make learning fun and challenging. Teachers work with curriculum developers to design games that build academic and social skills. In ELA courses, students use table games to debate the strength of evidence; in math, students use a card game, Absolute Dash, to mix and match integer operations to gain the most points. All students have small group advisory twice a week to build community and promote social-emotional learning. As they build skills, students demonstrate their learning through collaborative, creative projects, taking a variety of roles from newscast producer to Revolutionary War spy to roller-coaster architect. We make learning challenging. At the end of each semester, middle school students participate in week-long design competitions. Instead of regular classes, students work in groups of 12 to create projects such as fashion shows, restaurants, and newspapers. We are inclusive in how we accept students into our school -- we do not screen. We are also inclusive in our programming within our walls -- we do not place students in high, medium, or low classes. We challenge all students academically providing every 8th grade student with Earth Science and Algebra Regents courses.",
