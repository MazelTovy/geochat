    "The High School of Hospitality Management (HSHM) is an Early College High School located in the heart of the resurgent Clinton area of Manhattan.     HSHM has partnered with New York State Department of Education to create an innovative program that enables high school students to earn a high school diploma and up to 24 college credits by the 12th grade. HSHM offers a holistic high school experience with an engaging academic curriculum both within the school building and on college campuses.     Further, through our participation in New York City's Career Ready Modern Youth Apprenticeship and Future Ready NYC programs, HSHM provides a strong focus on personal development with extensive opportunities for career exploration. Our students have the opportunity to achieve professional certificates, as well as earn while they learn through apprenticeships and internships in data science, hospitality, culinary, and business industries. We are part of the Career Readiness and Modern Youth Apprenticeship (CRMYA) pilot, which helps us support career readiness for all our students. We have courses that help our ninth and tenth graders explore their career interests and develop readiness skills. Our students can apply for apprenticeships in tech, finance, and business, which allows them to earn and learn while in high school.",
