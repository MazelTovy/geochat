    "The Urban Assembly School of Design and Construction prepares students for college and beyond with an emphasis on architecture, engineering, art, and design. At the end of the 9th grade, students choose the focus for their electives in order to develop an art portfolio and receive an advance art endorsement or a design portfolio and work toward an Autocad certification when they graduate. Additionally, students engage in internships, job shadowing, and mentorship in their specific fields of interest through our corporate and non-profit partnerships. At SDC, we are also involved with the AP for All curriculum and have AP courses in all major subject areas. The goal at SDC is that every student is supported through an innovative and rigorous educational experience.",
