    "We aim to provide a place where education has no limits and no boundaries. Our programs focus on performing arts, science exploration, and math enrichment. We combine core content instruction with exposure to the arts, including a visiting artist program, providing students with many opportunities for success. During their three years at Renaissance School of the Arts (RSA), students receive intensive training in their chosen arts field. Upon graduation, students are ready to audition for performing arts high schools, and will have a strong foundation in all of the arts. Through our partnerships, the arts are integrated into all academic curricula and culminate in students participating in a professional performance. At RSA, we are passionate about the arts and have designed a program that supports that passion.",
