    "At the Talented and Gifted School for Young Scholars faculties, parents and students work together to prepare all students to excel in life and develop to their full potential, both intellectually and socially.   TAG's 6th-8th grade program features accelerated core academic classes (English, Math, Social Studies, and Science) that culminates in all 8th grade students taking Regents-level classes in each of these core academic subjects.   8th Grade students will take Regents classes and exams in Algebra, English/Language Arts, Science-Living Environment, and US History.  In addition to the core academic program, all 6th-8th grade students will play a musical instrument in the band, and take classes in visual arts.",
