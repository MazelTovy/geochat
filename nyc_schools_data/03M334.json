    "The Anderson Middle School (AMS) provides a judicious combination of an accelerated and enriched curriculum for the distinct needs of gifted learners. Our upper grades are fully integrated within our highly successful K-8 school. With only two classes per grade (one class in each of grades 6-8 is an ICT class), the relationship between students and teachers is personal and supportive. This smaller population fosters a strong sense of community from students who attend from all five boroughs of NYC. Guided by educators who recognize the needs of children with outstanding intellectual potential, we provide intimate, differentiated, and departmentalized instruction that encourages critical thinking, creative problem-solving, divergent thinking, research, independent study, collaboration, and self-evaluation. Parental involvement and support sustain the spirit and growth of AMS. The Anderson School seeks a diverse student population, including ICT students, and welcomes applications from all over NYC. Students must be prepared to work at a fast pace, to meet the challenges of a rigorous, accelerated curriculum in all core subjects.",
