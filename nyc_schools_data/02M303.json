      "As of September 2024 The Facing History School is a 6th through 12th grade public school located in the heart of Hells Kitchen that is home to over 450 students from across New York City. A short walk from the C/E/1 trains, our school is a member of the New York State Consortium. This allows our students to graduate with a NYS Regents diploma while only needing to sit for the English Regents. Being a part of the Consortium also allows our teachers to plan curriculum that is centered on project-based learning and performance-based tasks. Thanks to our 1-to-1 technology learning environment and new computer lab, our students are prepared for 21st century learning. Every year 95% of our graduating seniors attend a college or university. We ensure our 9th and 10th grade students are exposed to colleges and careers early on. This includes enrolling 9th graders in post-secondary planning programs, examining transcripts with each student, every semester to ensure on track graduation and credit accumulation as well as organizing and attending numerous college trips. Our 11th and 12th grade students enroll in SAT prep courses and an array of advanced coursework such as AP Statistics and AP Computer Science. Most notably, our seniors are all enrolled in our College 101 class taught by our college advisor who supports our young people through every step of the college application process, including financial aid support. Our young people also have a social, fun, and memorable high school experience. We offer a range of sports for our young people to participate in": "volleyball, basketball, tennis, bowling, and soccer. Our after-school programs are popular and robust with offerings such as music production, student government, chess club, K-pop club, cooking club, Gender and Sexuali"
