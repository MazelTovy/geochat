    "Being a member of East Side Middle School is being a member of a community that values each student's talents and ambitions. We also value the opportunities and responsibilities of each student to develop the leadership skills that they can apply to enhance whatever communities they join. An academically rigorous program, we strongly value the arts and have a great dance and visual arts program. We also value the emotional and mental well-being of our students as much as their academic success. All students at ESMS take courses in anti-bullying, resilience, healthy relationships, social and emotional literacy, and sexual health. Our after-school program offers programs in all team sports, the arts, including theater, STEAM programs, debate and Model UN. We have a vibrant LGBTQ community, and a great GSA. Our student council has worked on anti-hunger projects, no-naming calling weeks, international night and helped draft legislation that was signed into law in New York City. In our electives program, last period on Fridays, we offer classes in the arts, athletics and academics. Often, these classes are designed by and taught by our students. If a student wants to contribute to our community, it will happen. This school will give priority to applicants eligible for Free and Reduced Lunch (FRL) for up to 20 percent of seats",
