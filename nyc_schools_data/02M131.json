    "Dr. Sun Yat Sen Middle School believes that there is genius in every child. By providing many venues for our students to develop as scholars and people, ranging from our core curriculum in which all of our 8th graders take Algebra, and experience a curriculum full of reading, writing and discussion, there is something to challenge every student. 8th graders also have the option to take regents US History and Living Environment Regents Classes. In coding, students design their own video games. In basketball, volleyball, chess and other sports, they learn to work as a team. Through their trips to the both near and far (8th graders take a two night trip to Washington, D.C.), they learn to expand their horizons beyond the city limits. In addition to pushing our students academically, we teach our children positive social and emotional skills. Our advisory programs uses the principles of restorative practices to help students learn from their mistakes rather than just be punished by them. Our Student Government and GSA provide ways for students to take leadership in our school. Our faculty and staff work hard to build connections, which shows with the number of our alumni who come back to visit throughout the year. Please sign up for a group or personal tour so we can show you the great things MS 131 has to offer.  Whether you are interested in our Dual Language Mandarin program, our Accelerated Academic Program, ICT or our Horizon program, we would love to meet you!",
