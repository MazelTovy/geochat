    "Students appreciate our teachers' energy and enthusiasm for the subjects they teach, as well as their accessibility -- teachers are always happy to provide additional support in academics or to help students work through problems. Parents appreciate the value we place on building traditional academic and critical thinking skills. Our curriculum integrates learning about a range of issues and provides students with a structured form for taking action to make the world a better place for all. Students at PS/IS 276 have the opportunity to build leadership skills through participation in sports teams, student government and community service. We have studio art, a rich music program, a FabLab, and a wide range of electives in 8th grade. All eighth graders take Algebra 1 and Living Environment Regents courses. Students can graduate with distinction in Academics, Service, Arts, and/or Athletics. Through all this learning, parents recognize that we pay close attention to each student's academic, social, and emotional well being.
