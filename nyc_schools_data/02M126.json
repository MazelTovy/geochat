    "While at P.S. 126/MAT, students will engage in a creative and rigorous curriculum that is geared towards fostering collaboration, inquiry, research, public speaking, and overall social-emotional development. Students will interact and incorporate technology in all of the core classes, with opportunities to learn coding, animation, and robotics. In eighth grade, all of our students will be offered the course work necessary to take the Earth Science and Algebra I Regents exams as well as the Spanish Proficiency exam. Our elective program allows students to major in fine arts, percussion, or band; providing students the necessary skills and preparation for high school auditions.
