    "Gramercy Arts H.S. is a dual-mission high school that offers all students a well-rounded college preparatory education that balances rigorous academic coursework with four years of study in either the visual or theater arts. We believe that the creativity that is cultivated within our arts' curriculum supports student success across all subject areas. Offerings in core subjects are supplemented with a variety of AP and College Now courses. Graduates are expected to attain an Arts endorsed Regent's Diploma. Our Capstone program allows students to graduate with anywhere from 15 to 30 college credits from AP Exams and College Now, while maintaining access to our rich array of Arts courses.",
