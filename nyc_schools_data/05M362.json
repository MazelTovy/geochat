    "Students like our family atmosphere and the creative vibe of our teachers and courses. Students also like the opportunities to take courses at Columbia University in high school. Parents like the availability of the teachers and the cultural events that celebrate the diverse community, like our yearly musical, Black History Month celebration, and Hispanic Month celebration. Parents also appreciate the quality of the teachers and the breadth and depth of the curriculum. Columbia Secondary School for Math, Science, and Engineering has one of the only middle to high school engineering sequences in the state as well as a seven-year philosophy curriculum. We created our own community garden in partnership with the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, which has become an integral part of our community. Our school focuses on hands-on, inventive learning experiences, and our teachers develop field experiences that bring coursework into an authentic setting without losing rigor.",
