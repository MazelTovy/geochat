    "At Hamilton Grange success looks different for each of us. For some, it is starring in our 55-piece band, our school musical, or painting on one of our famous murals. For others it is participating in a combination of activities that include competing as members of one of our 15 athletic teams (cheerleading, soccer, basketball, baseball, softball, boxing, bouldering, fencing, sailing, and hiking). We pride ourselves on providing myriad opportunities to our students through school day electives like debate, theater, and weightlifting, and supporting academic success through culturally responsive teaching practices. We have earned local and national recognition for our students' academic growth and our progressive approach to discipline - we use restorative practices rather than detentions or suspensions (We have twice been named a NYC Showcase School for School Culture, were NY State's only middle grades Reward School in 2017-18 because our kids made more progress on their state exams than any other students at any other school in NY State, and Teach for America named us 1 of just 4 Schools To Learn From in the United States in 2018-2019). We hope to see you soon!",
