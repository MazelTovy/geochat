      "The Lower Manhattan Arts Academy (LoMA) is an arts-focused high school that provides students with 4 years of world-class instruction in their chosen arts major": "Visual Art, Music, Theater, and Dance, without having to audition or submit a portfolio. At LoMA, we believe that ALL students can be engaged in high-level academic and cultural experiences and are capable of achieving at the highest levels, regardless of past academic history or past arts experiences. In addition to taking 4 years of English, social studies, mathematics, science, physical education, and up to 3 years of Spanish, LoMA students graduate with 10 or more credits in the arts, which ensures that all students meet or exceed New York State's graduation requirements. There are several opportunities to take Advance Placement courses as well. Our students apply and get accepted to a wide range of colleges and other post-secondary institutions: the most competitive private schools, arts colloboratives, local community college, trade schools, and more, and we pride ourselves in helping LoMA students create a unique and differentiated 4-year high school experience. Our students come from many cultural, linguistic, socio-economic, and intellectual backgrounds, and we prize that diversity by ensuring that we support everyone's growth and progress toward the shared goal of post-secondary success!"
