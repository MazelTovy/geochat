    "We are a college prep school founded on the belief that mastery of communication skills in both English and a students' home language is key to realizing a student's potential in a multicultural society. We are committed to assisting students in maintaining the richness of their home language and culture and celebrating their individual differences, while providing them with a sense of place in their community and society as a whole. Our mission is to ensure that students develop the bilingual speaking, reading, writing, and listening skills designed to prepare them for higher education and the work force. We are part of the Career Readiness and Modern Youth Apprenticeship (CRMYA) pilot, which helps us support career readiness for all our students. We have courses that help our ninth and tenth graders explore their career interests and develop readiness skills. Our students can apply for apprenticeships in tech, finance, and business, which allows them to earn and learn while in high school.
