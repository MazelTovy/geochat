    "At 217, we pride ourselves on being a \"big city school with a small-town feel.\" Our small class sizes allow our teachers to get to know students on a deeply personal level. Additionally, subject area teachers follow the same group of students through sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, which provides our students with the opportunity to interact with their teachers academically and socially throughout middle school. Our families appreciate the support they receive during their children's transition from elementary school to middle school. We offer a wide array of opportunities for students to explore their non-academic interests during the school day. We also provide academic enrichment throughout the year. We have a modern building that is open, clean, and bright. Our hallways are lined with flags representing the countries of our many international students and families. Our state-of-the-art facilities offer updated computer labs, and ActiveBoards in every classroom.",
