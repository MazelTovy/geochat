    "At Landmark, we believe students learn best when they are known well as individuals by caring adults, and when their studies are driven by passion and curiosity. Our students do in-depth research projects and present them to teachers and other experts instead of sitting for Regents exams, through a NYS waiver as a member of the NYS Performance Assessment Consortium. This process prepares students well for the demands of college. We are committed to helping students find and develop their passions through a breadth of electives, clubs, and internships. Students earn college credits through College Now and AP classes. Our advisory and restorative justice programs ensure that all students have strong, trusting relationships with adults and peers to support a close-knit community. We are part of the Career Readiness and Modern Youth Apprenticeship (CRMYA) pilot, which helps us support career readiness for all our students. We have courses that help our ninth and tenth graders explore their career interests and develop readiness skills. Our students can apply for apprenticeships in tech, finance, and business, which allows them to earn and learn while in high school.
