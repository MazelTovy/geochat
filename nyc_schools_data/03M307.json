    "UAM is a school that is focused on bringing out the best in all students' thinking so that they are able to achieve at high levels. UAM graduates are able to respond to the world by making choices that maximize positive outcomes for themselves and others. UAM is focused on students becoming better critical thinkers, not just acquiring more knowledge. As a result our students are able to respond productively in novel situations. UAM students are able to solve problems, access, analyze, and evaluate information and messages from a range of media, make a decision, and express their thinking verbally and in writing. As a result, UAM students are prepared to perform well in college, their career, life and be productive members of communities. We are part of the Career Readiness and Modern Youth Apprenticeship (CRMYA) pilot, which helps us support career readiness for all our students. We have courses that help our ninth and tenth graders explore their career interests and develop readiness skills. Our students can apply for apprenticeships in tech, finance, and business, which allows them to earn and learn while in high school.
