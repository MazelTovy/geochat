Our Labbies put the \"lab\" in collaborative! Our academically nurturing and rigorous environment fosters curiosity and lifelong learning. Students engage in inquiry across all disciplines. In humanities classes, we combine social studies and ELA and offer enrichment courses on unique topics. To enhance our core curriculum, we provide Regents math and science courses for students ready for the challenge. Students also participate in national competitions (math, writing, and vocabulary) and work with local arts organizations. We are proud of our inclusion program and offer supports so all students succeed: full- and part-time ICT classes, small group specialized instruction, executive functioning support, and all related services. Across the three years, all students take typing, transitions to middle school, coding, advisory, visual art, and drama. Our PA works tirelessly to supplement students' experiences and organize family events such as a Lunar New Year celebration. Former Labbies report back that teachers' high expectations and three years of Spanish have prepared them well for high school.

At LoMA, we believe that ALL students can be engaged in high-level academic and cultural experiences and are capable of achieving at the highest levels, regardless of past academic history or past arts experiences. In addition to taking 4 years of English, social studies, mathematics, science, physical education, and up to 3 years of Spanish, LoMA students graduate with 10 or more credits in the arts, which ensures that all students meet or exceed New York State's graduation requirements. There are several opportunities to take Advance Placement courses as well. Our students apply and get accepted to a wide range of colleges and other post-secondary institutions: the most competitive private schools, arts colloboratives, local community college, trade schools, and more, and we pride ourselves in helping LoMA students create a unique and differentiated 4-year high school experience. Our students come from many cultural, linguistic, socio-economic, and intellectual backgrounds, and we prize that diversity by ensuring that we support everyone's growth and progress toward the shared goal of post-secondary success!\nSch-demog: Asian: 7%, Black: 32%, Hispanic or Latinx: 56%, Native American: <1%, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander: <1%, White: 3%, English language learners: 7%, Students with IEPs: 29%, Economic Need Index: 90%, Female: 63%, Male: 36%, Neither female nor male: <1%\nProgram: Boys: Bowling,Basketball,Handball,Baseball,Volleyball,Badminton,Wrestling,Soccer, Girls: Badminton,Softball,Basketball,Tennis,Volleyball,Table Tennis,Swimming,Wrestling,Bowling, Co-Ed: N/A\nStaff: Asian: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), Black: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), Hispanic or Latinx: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), Native American: 0%, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander: 0%, White: 63%, Years of experience as principal at this school: 1.9, Teachers with 3 or more years of experience: 80%\nSpace: Shared space: Yes, colocated (02M294, 02M305, 02M543, 02M545)\nCcr: Comparison Group*: 55%  Manhattan: 66% City: 64%, (Number of students successfully completing out of 77 seniors): \nGrad: Comparison Group*: 86%  Manhattan: 87% City: 88%\nProg-to-grad: Comparison Group*: 69%  Manhattan: 86% City: 84%\nLearning-env: Manhattan: 77% City: 77%\nSafety: Manhattan: 75% City: 74%\nSchool-leadership: Manhattan: 81% City: 82%\nAdvising: Manhattan: 86% City: 86%\nAttendance: Student attendance: 75% (Comp group*: 77%), Students with >90% attendance: 39% (Comp group*: 45%), Teacher attendance: 95%\nStu-support: Manhattan: 73% City: 73%\nCommunication: Manhattan: 91% City: 92%\nFamily-involve: Manhattan: 84% City: 83%\nRelation-w-family: Manhattan: 93% City: 94%\nSchool Values: Value 1: 28, Value 2: 43%, Value 3: 43%, Value 4: 82%, Value 5: 85%, Value 6: 69%, Value 7: 64%, Value 8: 73%, Value 9: 71%, Value 10: 79%, Value 11: 80%, Value 12: 67%, Value 13: 87%, Value 14: 78%, Value 15: 92%"}

Our 11th and 12th grade students enroll in SAT prep courses and an array of advanced coursework such as AP Statistics and AP Computer Science.

Your teachers and I look forward to this school year which promises to be an exciting, enriching and full of learning.\nSch-demog: Asian: 4%, Black: 16%, Hispanic or Latinx: 37%, Native American: <1%, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander: 0%, White: 33%, English language learners: 14%, Students with IEPs: 30%, Economic Need Index: 53%, Female: 45%, Male: 55%, Neither female nor male: 0%\nProgram: Boys: N/A, Girls: N/A, Co-Ed: N/A, DYCD: COMPASS/SONYC; NYC Reads; Respect for All\nStaff: Asian: 10%, Black: 19%, Hispanic or Latinx: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), Native American: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), White: 67%, Years of experience as principal at this school: 1.9, Teachers with three or more years of experience: 69%\nSpace: Shared space: Yes, colocated (03M256, 03M258)\nNext-level: Comparison Group*: 93% District 03: 87%  City: 90%\nCore-course: Comparison Group*: 98% District 03: 92%  City: 92%\nLearning-env: District 03: 80%  City: 77%\nPerf: Comparison Group*: 57% District 03: 64%  City: 49%\nPerf2: Comparison Group*: 60% District 03: 65%  City: 53%\nSafety: District 03: 74%  City: 63%\nSchool-leadership: District 03: 82%  City: 81%\nAdvising: District 03: 86%  City: 88%\nAttendance: Student attendance: 87% (Comp group*: 92%), Students with >90% attendance: 60% (Comp group*: 70%), Teacher attendance: 97%\nStu-support: District 03: 76%  City: 70%\nCommunication: District 03: 94%  City: 94%\nFamily-involve: District 03: 91%  City: 90%\nRelation-w-family: District 03: 93%  City: 94%\nSchool Values: Value 1: 97%, Value 2: 53%, Value 3: 86%, Value 4: 72%, Value 5: 62%, Value 6: 55%, Value 7: 70%, Value 8: 72%, Value 9: 83%, Value 10: 69%, Value 11: 94%, Value 12: 88%, Value 13: 93%"}

Our collaborative teaching staff ensures that all students receive individualized support for high levels of academic growth. Our curriculum, aligned to the Common Core, challenges and engages our students. We are currently in the process of being certified as an International Baccalaureate (IB) school. The IB program is designed to develop well-rounded individuals who can respond to today's challenges with optimism and an open mind. It enables teachers to cultivate resilient, self-motivated young people with the knowledge, skills, and sense of purpose they need to thrive throughout their lives and contribute to making the world a better place. Our students enjoy frequent academic and cultural trips to complement lessons learned in the classroom, leveraging the rich resources of New York City as a learning tool. Two of our most popular trips are our three-day/two-night camping trip  to the Clearpool Environmental Education Center in upstate New York to build teamwork and community and our annual school-wide Broadway trip.  All 8th-grade students are enrolled in two Regents level classes: Algebra 1 and Biology. We place a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary learning, encouraging students to explore topics from multiple perspectives across different subjects. Our advisory program focuses on student goal-setting and nurturing the social and emotional growth of our students. Parents value the way that administrators and instructors make themselves available to assist with any concerns. Our robust afterschool program includes sports, arts, and academic options, alongside a Saturday Academy program that runs from October thr\nSch-demog: Asian: <1%, Black: 31%, Hispanic or Latinx: 60%, Native American: 0%, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander: 0%, White: 7%, English language learners: 21%, Students with IEPs: 47%, Economic Need Index: 89%, Female: 45%, Male: 55%, Neither female nor male: 0%\nProgram: Boys: N/A, Girls: N/A, Co-Ed: N/A, Community School; DYCD: Beacon; Project Pivot; Respect for All\nStaff: Asian: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), Black: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), Hispanic or Latinx: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), Native American: 0%, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander: 0%, White: 72%, Years of experience as principal at this school: 7.2, Teachers with three or more years of experience: 83%\nSpace: Shared space: Yes, colocated (03M256, 03M333)\nNext-level: Comparison Group*: 89% District 03: 92%  City: 91%\nCore-course: Comparison Group*: 98% District 03: 96%  City: 95%\nLearning-env: District 03: 81%  City: 77%\nPerf: Comparison Group*: 37% District 03: 63%  City: 51%\nPerf2: Comparison Group*: 39% District 03: 63%  City: 51%\nSafety: District 03: 73%  City: 63%\nSchool-leadership: District 03: 88%  City: 84%\nAdvising: District 03: 90%  City: 89%\nAttendance: Student attendance: 87% (Comp group*: 100%), Students with >90% attendance: 46% (Comp group*: 73%), Teacher attendance: 96%\nStu-support: District 03: 73%  City: 71%\nCommunication: District 03: 94%  City: 94%\nFamily-involve: District 03: 89%  City: 87%\nRelation-w-family: District 03: 95%  City: 94%\nSchool Values: Value 1: 89%, Value 2: 58%, Value 3: 96%, Value 4: 81%, Value 5: 35%, Value 6: 36%, Value 7: 75%, Value 8: 90%, Value 9: 94%, Value 10: 82%, Value 11: 99%, Value 12: 97%, Value 13: 100%"}

During their three years of middle school we seek to challenge students to think creatively, solve challenges, and engage with peers to build connection and share ideas and experiences.  At LMC students take four arts courses: Digital Arts, Dance, Music, and Visual Arts and have the opportunity engage with the art course to which they feel the greatest connection.  Every day our students begin in a small advisory group of 10-12 of their peers.  Led by one of their teachers, our advisory curriculum explores such topics as goal-setting, identity, values, service, and human rights.  Our advisories serve as a structure around which we plan the many field trips in which our students participate throughout the year, including overnight trips.  In advisory we also prepare students for the opportunity of \"out lunch\" for which students in good academic standing are eligible after the first trimester of 6th grade.  At LMC our robust after school program, developed in partnership with Manhattan Youth, build on our arts, academic, and advisory programs through daily programming that is free of charge.\nSch-demog: Asian: 25%, Black: 9%, Hispanic or Latinx: 27%, Native American: 0%, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander: 0%, White: 33%, English language learners: 13%, Students with IEPs: 28%, Economic Need Index: 52%, Female: 52%, Male: 48%, Neither female nor male: 0%\nProgram: Boys: N/A, Girls: N/A, Co-Ed: N/A, DYCD: COMPASS/SONYC; NYC Solves; PROSE\nStaff: Asian: 20%, Black: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), Hispanic or Latinx: 20%, Native American: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), White: 53%, Years of experience as principal at this school: 4.8, Teachers with three or more years of experience: 87%\nSpace: Shared space: Yes, colocated (02M316, 02M580)\nNext-level: Comparison Group*: 94% District 02: 94%  City: 91%\nCore-course: Comparison Group*: 99% District 02: 98%  City: 95%\nLearning-env: District 02: 76%  City: 77%\nPerf: Comparison Group*: 75% District 02: 75%  City: 51%\nPerf2: Comparison Group*: 69% District 02: 76%  City: 51%\nSafety: District 02: 67%  City: 63%\nSchool-leadership: District 02: 82%  City: 84%\nAdvising: District 02: 83%  City: 89%\nAttendance: Student attendance: 92% (Comp group*: 100%), Students with >90% attendance: 74% (Comp group*: 97%), Teacher attendance: 97%\nStu-support: District 02: 68%  City: 71%\nCommunication: District 02: 90%  City: 94%\nFamily-involve: District 02: 88%  City: 87%\nRelation-w-family: District 02: 91%  City: 94%\nSchool Values: Value 1: 95%, Value 2: 63%, Value 3: 99%, Value 4: 77%, Value 5: 76%, Value 6: 60%, Value 7: 76%, Value 8: 91%, Value 9: 90%, Value 10: 73%, Value 11: 95%, Value 12: 93%, Value 13: 98%"}

While we offer a rigorous academic curriculum culminating in 8th grade Algebra Regents, we prioritize a whole child approach to learning where students are provided with a learning environment and experiences to thrive academically, social-emotionally, and physically. Our instructors utilize a School Wide Enrichment Model (SEM) Program and offer a variety of activities which include a visual arts, music, and STEM curriculum, Career Day, Science & Robotics Fairs, and celebrations via concerts and classroom displays. Additional academic supports are provided after school such as our After School, Holiday Break, and Saturday Academies and Junior High School Art Portfolio Program.  Our school enjoys partnerships with multiple organizations including a school-based mental health clinic and prevention team through Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital,  92nd St. Y Music and Dance; CHAMPS and PSAL after school sports (Basketball, Volleyball, Softball, Cheerleading, etc.) and Track & Field program at the Armory, ICS/Compass, Center for Arts Education; Creative Arts Work; and the Situation Project where middle school students attend two Broadway shows a year.  We offer an early drop-off breakfast program at 7: 30 am and after-school programs Monday-Friday for students in all grades.

The school prepares students for professional music careers while recognizing that not every student will choose such a career. The underlying philosophy of the Special Music School is the belief that music education for gifted pupils requires: 1) extensive opportunities to work one-to-one with an outstanding instrumental faculty; 2) a structured, sequential music curriculum; 3) opportunities to perform before audiences; and 4) interaction between general academics and musical studies. Our goal is to see each child reach his or her academic and musical potential. Our vision is that all students will become lifelong learners and critical thinkers in our caring and respectful learning environment. We encourage parental involvement in all aspects of the school.\nSch-demog: Asian: 28%, Black: 5%, Hispanic or Latinx: 10%, Native American: 0%, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander: 2%, White: 33%, English language learners: 2%, Students with IEPs: 8%, Economic Need Index: 29%, Female: 51%, Male: 49%, Neither female nor male: 0%\nProgram: Boys: N/A, Girls: N/A, Co-Ed: N/A\nStaff: Asian: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), Black: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), Hispanic or Latinx: N/A (fewer than 5 teachers), Native American: 0%, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander: 0%, White: 58%, Years of experience as principal at this school: 14.4, Teachers with three or more years of experience: 75%\nSpace: Shared space: Yes, colocated (03M307, 03M492, 03M494, 03M541)\nNext-level: Comparison Group*: N/A District 03: 87%  City: 90%\nCore-course: Comparison Group*: 99% District 03: 92%  City: 92%\nLearning-env: District 03: 80%  City: 75%\nPerf: Comparison Group*: 82% District 03: 64%  City: 49%\nPerf2: Comparison Group*: 84% District 03: 65%  City: 53%\nSafety: District 03: 74%  City: 65%\nSchool-leadership: District 03: 82%  City: 79%\nAdvising: District 03: 86%  City: 83%\nAttendance: Student attendance: 96% (Comp group*: 99%), Students with >90% attendance: 94% (Comp group*: 89%), Teacher attendance: 98%\nStu-support: District 03: 76%  City: 68%\nCommunication: District 03: 94%  City: 91%\nFamily-involve: District 03: 91%  City: 86%\nRelation-w-family: District 03: 93%  City: 92%\nSchool Values: Value 1: N/A, Value 2: N/A, Value 3: 100%, Value 4: 82%, Value 5: 99%, Value 6: 99%, Value 7: 84%, Value 8: 85%, Value 9: 83%, Value 10: 75%, Value 11: N/A, Value 12: N/A, Value 13: N/A"}
