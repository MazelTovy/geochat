    "Wadleigh Middle School is a warm and welcoming artistically rich environment. Our scholars have the unique opportunity to receive three years of performing and visual arts instruction as they complete a rigorous Common Core-Aligned curriculum. Middle school students perform alongside our high school students during showcases and other special events throughout the year. Wadleigh is distinctive in that it also exposes students to the arts via career and school fairs, cultural awareness events, arts competitions, school trips and other artistic events. Middle school students also participate in Early College Awareness activities and attend Wadleigh college tours and fairs. Our scholars are also offered advanced Regents courses and participate in varied sports, tutoring, and a wide choice of after-school programs. Wadleigh parents appreciate our family-like environment which allows their children to grow individually and excel academically and artistically.  This program prioritizes 25% of seats for students who qualify for the federal free or reduced price lunch program (FRL).",
