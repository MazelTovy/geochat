    "We offer a college-preparatory program and New York City's only comprehensive three-part theater arts sequence, where students hone their skills in music, dance, and acting. Students completing our program graduate with an Advanced Regents diploma with an Arts Endorsement in Theater. Our location in Times Square supports our school's focus. Our small size offers students an intimate environment to explore all aspects of theater from production to performance. Students participate in numerous class-based productions each year, and also have the opportunity to participate in our mainstage musical and straight play productions. Our balance of arts and academics allows our graduates to pursue a multitude of post-secondary paths.",
