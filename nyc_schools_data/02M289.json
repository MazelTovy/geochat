    "An I.S 289er enjoys a small, caring, and academically rigorous environment. Students engage in collaborative projects in all classes to investigate problems or engage in civic issues.  A 289er graduates with a strong sense of agency and responsibility.   Graduates return to 289 and share that they felt well prepared for the academic expectations of high school.  The school's high expectations are accompanied by high levels of support; for example, our Academic Coaching program assigns each student to an adult on campus who meets regularly with the student to review academic performance and set goals.  Our robust after-school program includes competitive sports, visual and digital arts, music, coding, and technology activities.",
