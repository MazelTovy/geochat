    "Our mission at the Island School is to be relentless in our pursuit of best practices to support student success. One way that we have done that?and will continue to do it?is by giving students a wide array of experiences so that they can identify areas of interest and talent and then develop those interests and talents into lifelong passions. Our faculty is committed to helping each of our children reach their full academic potential. We are developing a culture of college-minded students and working with community members to create a challenging learning environment. As a Community School, we look at how we can support the whole child.  We provide services not only for our children but for our families. Parents like that we help identify and nurture their children's interest as well as their own talents. Parents appreciate our partnerships with high schools such as Bard High School Early College and Orchard Collegiate High School.",
