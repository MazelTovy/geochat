    "MS177 prepares students to be critical thinkers, effective problem solvers and powerful communicators in a rapidly changing 21st century world. By embracing academic rigor, student voice, collaboration, self-direction, and empathy, our students will have the confidence, tenacity and skills for success. We pride ourselves on our small, tight-knit community in which every adult knows every child and helps support their growth throughout their three years of middle school. To do this, we utilize individualized and small group instruction across all classrooms.     Our advisory periods allow for daily check-ins and the reinforcement of our core values to help our students build strong bonds and respectful relationships with their peers through the use of Restorative Practices.  We embrace what makes our students unique while also highlighting all that brings us together as humans, and we prioritize equity throughout our school community.     To enhance students' love for learning, we offer enrichment classes in math, art, science, physical education, theater and debate. This approach allows students to continue exploring the different topics that might interest them while providing the solid foundation necessary for success in high school and beyond.    This school prioritizes 25% of seats for students who are eligible for free or reduced price lunch (FRL).",
