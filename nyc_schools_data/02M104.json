    "Simon Baruch Middle School is a traditional middle school committed to developing students who think critically and who are civic minded. The school utilizes a house structure as an organizational model that allows teachers to know our students well. An assistant principal and guidance counselor are assigned to every grade level to ensure that support services are available to all students. We offer all students the chance to engage in a rigorous academic curriculum that challenges students to think critically and independently. Students engage in a balance of independent learning tasks and collaborative learning experiences. Our rigorous core content is supplemented by extensive arts and technology offerings that provide students with opportunities to develop their interests and talents. Our school supplements the regular instructional program with an extensive afterschool program that provides students with academic enrichment, academic intervention, arts, and athletics.",
