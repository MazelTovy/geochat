    "Our mission is to provide a challenging academic program. In grades 9 and 10, students take core curriculum courses that include biology, chemistry, English, math, and global studies. In grades 11 and 12, they continue core math and history while choosing from a range of English, science, and elective classes. Every entering 9th grader is assigned an advisor, and an advisory group of 15 to 20 peers, for their four-year arc. We offer a comprehensive college counseling program, which includes direct instruction and individualized support in the college application process from our college counselors. An 18-week college process curriculum, spanning 11th and 12th grades, is delivered to advisory groups during dedicated school-day sessions.",
