    "Our mission at Urban Assembly Academy for Future Leaders (AFL) is to welcome learners who have broad intellectual interests. We encourage our scholars to develop their wide spectrum of knowledge. Rather than limiting students' adolescent curiosity by having them specialize in one academic area, AFL supports our scholars' intense desire to know and understand. At AFL, we foster an environment that promotes adolescent development and demands academic excellence. Though we are a very small school, we offer our students an abundance of professional opportunities and experiences. Our students travel and get real-life experience to support what they are learning in class. Students at AFL can take advantage of our top-ranked athletic program; science, technology and arts-based elective courses; and advisory program. We challenge, support, and expose our students to the ways in which highly successful people think, so that throughout their three years at AFL they may hone their skills and leave our doors ready to lead the world.",
