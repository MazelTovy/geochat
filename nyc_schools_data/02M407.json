    "The Institute for Collaborative Education (ICE) is a small, community-focused school where the needs and academic interests of our students come first. Teachers utilize a project-based curriculum that emphasizes student-centered inquiry, forming substantive arguments, written and oral presentations, and the active and ongoing exchange of ideas.
