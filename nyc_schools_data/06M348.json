    "As a pre-K-12 school, our mission is to work with families to prepare each student academically, emotionally, intellectually, and socially to succeed in a college or career of their choice. At WHEELS, we provide students with a strong academic foundation, teach socio-emotional skills and habits of work and learning, and work to actively build a strong community. As an Expeditionary Learning/Outward Bound school we utilize interdisciplinary learning units that begin with compelling questions and employ authentic learning experiences (through fieldwork and experts) that culminate in students creating authentic products in real world formats. There are numerous opportunities for students to participate in extracurricular activities; we have a strong music program, offer a number of sports clubs, and put on a school musical each year (Broadway Junior).  Student interest drives club creation, resulting in programs such as Fashion Club, Anime Club, Esports and Spirit Club. We offer a small environment where teachers care about students and expect the best of them. Our crew (advisory) structure allows each student to be paired with one caring adult to help guide their school experience. Parents appreciate our school's communication with families, our teacher accessibility and accountability, and the high levels of academic expectations, performance, and progress. Our school, which is one of the highest rated schools in NYC, has been highlighted and featured in various media, including NBC's Today Show, ABC World News, and the New York Times.",
