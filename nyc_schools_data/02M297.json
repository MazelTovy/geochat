    "At 75 Morton we recognize that every member of our diverse student body has a unique path to follow.  It is our mission to empower every student to inquire, question, create and evolve as a part of this community to achieve success in high school and beyond.  Students at 75 Morton will have many unique opportunities and experiences to enrich their lives inside and outside of the classroom.  We have partnerships with Urban Advantage, Theater for a New Audience (TFNA), Urban Word, Arts Connection, Open Door Arts in Education and SunWorks.  All 8th-grade students take the Algebra 1 and Living Environments Regents. 75 Morton also has an extensive Arts Department.  All students in 7th and 8th grade choose between STEAM, Visual Art, Chorus, Instrumental Music and Drama as their intensive, which will meet 5 times each week.  Students in the 6th grade experience each of these specials over the course of the year.  The facilities at 75 Morton include three state-of-the-art science labs with hydroponic labs, a Gymatorium, a yard, a light-filled Cafeteria, a roof garden, and a beautiful library with a full time librarian.
