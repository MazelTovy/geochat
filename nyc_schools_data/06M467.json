    "At the High School for Law and Public Service, we believe in the power of community. Parents, caregivers, and staff are integral to our mission of providing students with opportunities to become invested in their communities. Through service learning, internships, mentoring programs, and partnerships, our students are able to apply their academic knowledge to real-life settings. They also develop important life skills such as community building and conflict resolution through Restorative Justice practices led by students. Our RJ students focus on building strong and healthy relationships, working in circles to improve gender, racial and socio-economic equity. Our students are provided with Advanced Placement Courses, a Law Program with a state-of-the-art courtroom, a diversity of clubs, and an NJROTC program.  Additionally, we partner with Dominican Writers, People Theater's Program, Justice Resource Center, Dominicanos USA (DUSA), District Attorney's Office, and Dream Squad to enhance their learning experiences.",
