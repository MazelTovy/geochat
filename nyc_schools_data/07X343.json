    "M.S. 343 is a small school committed to providing a meaningful learning experience, focusing on technology, to prepare students for the 21st Century.  Students enjoy the small learning environment which provides them with both individual and group experiences.  They also benefit from block programming (75-minute periods) and looping philosophy (students have the same content teachers for all three years), which allows teachers to understand and support students' strengths and simultaneously address their needs.  Additionally, technology is incorporated into all content areas, creating a hands-on approach that students benefit from.  Students also enjoy our incentive trips, our extensive after-school program, and our thriving sports program.  Parents appreciate our online grading system that is accessible anywhere at any time via internet or text message to monitor their child's academic progress.  We have a small and caring learning environment that caters to the individual needs of each student as well as their family.",
