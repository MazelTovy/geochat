      "Through close partnerships with the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) and the Advertising and media industry, our school prepares students for success at four-year colleges and competitive careers. Students can earn an associate degree at no cost in addition to their CTE-endorsed high school Regents diploma through our inclusion in CUNY's PTech program. During their first four years, students participate in job shadowing, field trips, training seminars, and summer internships. Additionally, students begin taking college courses during the fall of their 10th grade year. All of our community members are accountable for our four core values": "Scholarship, Creativity, Responsibility, and Empathy. Students are held to high standards and expected to participate in the development of our community."
