    "The Urban Assembly School for Emergency Management (UASEM) is an innovative early college and career technical education (CTE) high school nestled in the Lower East side of Manhattan that prepares students for careers in medicine, healthcare, emergency management and response.    UASEM provides a unique opportunity for students to earn a high school diploma, up to 31 credits toward an Associates Degree in Applied Science in Paramedicine, a National Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) Certification, and gain relevant work experience in the healthcare field. UASEM has developed strong partnerships with the New York City Department of Education??s Office of Student Pathways, the Borough of Manhattan Community College, as well as Northwell Health, who serve as our industry partner and provide our students with internships and meaningful work based learning experiences.     UASEM is home to the only student-led CPR team in the country. The Hands to Heart CPR Team is composed of students who train community members in Hands Only CPR, a technique that has been shown to greatly improve the probability of surviving a cardiac event. Students work to train those in neighborhoods with the slowest ambulance response times. Students have trained almost 2,000 New Yorkers since its launch.    By engaging in authentic learning experiences in our classrooms and in the field, students develop the confidence, knowledge, skills, and network required to pursue their dreams and the character to serve their communities. Our community is R.E.A.D.Y. to solve complex problems, with strategic problem solving, that lead to real solutions. We believe in a holistic approach to education, pairing our core values of being resilient, emphatic, achievement oriented, deliberate and your own ally, with a ri",
