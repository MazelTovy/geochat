    "We are an inclusive ensemble, empowering diverse individuals to collaborate, explore, and take responsibility for authentic, bold choices in a student-centered learning environment. We provide our students with a rigorous dual focus in both the performing arts and liberal arts, with students taking 3 performance classes and 4 liberal arts classes each year. The balance of the two supports all students to become life-long artists and learners. Students perform in grades 9-12 in a variety of performance settings, both intimate and grand, in school and throughout NYC and beyond. Our staff sets high expectations for all students. Our guidance team ensures that each child is supported in various ways over the course of every year. Our learning community is comprised of families from all five boroughs, mirroring the diversity of NYC Public Schools. We are conveniently located one block from our CUNY partner, Hunter College, on the Upper East Side.",
