Expeditions engage students in case studies that examine and analyze compelling topics from a variety of perspectives, often working with experts in the field. A comprehensive arts program offers students a cultural foundation in which their innate sense of wonder will thrive.  This program prioritizes 25% of seats for students who qualify for the federal free or reduced lunch program."
