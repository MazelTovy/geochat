    "At A School Without Walls, we center the lives and interests of students through a curriculum focused on real world dilemmas, problem-solving, and student action. Our school is open to all students across the city who are interested in real-world learning, and who are seeking a non-traditional learning experience that incorporates meaningful study through projects and internships. At the core of our curriculum is the student Passion Project, a chance for every student to explore their personal interests through a cycle of academic research, internships, and presentations of learning. Our hybrid model provides the flexibility we need to support real world learning throughout students' four years of high school, while also offering coursework that will prepare students for college and careers. We support student wellness through team building field work and in-school classes and extracurricular activities, while also offering individualized academic support, small class sizes, and an interdisciplinary curriculum across the school. In the 9th grade, we blend in-person classes, field work experiences, and remote learning that engages students in projects that incorporate the many resources NYC has to offer. Beginning in 10th grade, students will spend half of their time in our school building and part time off campus engaged in remote learning, internships, work-based learning, and early college coursework. At A School Without Walls, we believe in the power of young people to transform communities if given the time and space to pursue their interests and passions, while completing their graduation requirements. Our school is for everyone, and we deeply believe that all experiences, identities, cultures, passions, concerns and solutions deserve exploration, cultivation and t",
