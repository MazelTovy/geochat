    "NYCPS has proposed the truncation of the middle school grades of PS/MS 180, pending approval by the Panel for Educational Policy (PEP). We expect the PEP to vote on this proposal on October 30, 2024. If this proposal is approved, any families with students who applied to P.S./M.S. 180 will have that choice removed from their middle school applications. Please ensure you list other middle schools on your application. The middle school at PS/IS 180 is a small environment where everyone knows everyone.   Having only two classes per grade allows the teachers to really get to know the individual needs of every student.  Our school offers a rigorous academic program where all 8th graders take the Living Environment and Algebra 1 regents exams in June. There are also plenty of opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities like student council, girls and boys' basketball, cheerleading, football, speech and debate.....and more. Our school believes in mastery based grading and is partnered with Outward Bound for our Crew/Advisory program. As our name suggests, we have a strong belief that all our students will go to college.  With that in mind, our 7th graders visit several colleges (both in state and out of state) each year.",
