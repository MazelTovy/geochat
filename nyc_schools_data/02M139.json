    "Stephen T. Mather Building Arts and Craftsmanship High School is a multiple pathways school founded in partnership with the National Park Service. At Mather, students can prepare for college with our many advanced placement courses and project-based learning  and/or learn a skilled trade such as carpentry, masonry, landscape management, and decorative finishing as part of our historic preservation CTE program. Our school is a safe, caring environment that supports the social emotional needs of our students through our advisory program, restorative practices, and dedication to our core values. We offer many extracurricular activities such as work-based learning trips, clubs, and PSAL sports.    Mather High School strives to provide a supportive and sustaining educational community that is diverse, inclusive, and equitable. We use data to consistently identify the institutional barriers, including racism and bias, that contribute to disparate educational outcomes within our school community and system at large. This work is continuous, requiring reflection and commitment to secure the best outcomes for all students. We work towards sustaining a community where collaboration is the norm, student voice is uplifted, and all community stakeholders work together to build stronger relationships and instructional practices to ensure equity, access, and positive outcomes for all students.",
