    "A rising star in the district, Lafayette Academy is a small school with approximately 150 students and is home to some of the most dynamic and engaged teachers in New York City. We are a community with a passion for educational excellence. Our school's size enables us to provide a supportive, diverse learning environment which fosters each student's academic, emotional, and athletic growth. Our successful French Dual Language Program, the only one in Manhattan, provides students from French dual-language programs and French native speakers the opportunity to further their study of French language arts and select content area courses in French. Recognizing the many developmental changes that middle school students face, we focus our practices and curriculum on supporting our students to ensure they are ready to tackle the challenges of high school and beyond. We empower our students to become productive citizens and leaders in our school and all facets of their lives. Our graduates have been accepted into schools such as Brooklyn Tech, Bard, Beacon, Laguardia, NYC iSchool, NYC Museum School, Pace High School, and other high achieving high schools around the city.",
