    "The Salk School is a small, nurturing community that emphasizes critical thinking skills in a fun, collaborative environment. Our curriculum is designed to value student interest and creativity, tapping into children's natural curiosity and desire to do good in the world while engaging with powerful ideas across disciplines.  Over the course of three years, we seek to nurture our students as scientists, writers, historians, artists, mathematicians, and compassionate human beings. We help them develop strong voices, an appreciation for diversity, a sense of responsibility and the passion and resilience to grapple with hard problems. Named after Dr. Jonas Salk, our school is a place where students come to see science as a way of making sense of the natural world through observation, experimentation, and an open and critical exchange of ideas. Salk students leave appreciating that science, ideally, is humanity's attempt to make the world better for all living things and to ensure the health of our planet.",
