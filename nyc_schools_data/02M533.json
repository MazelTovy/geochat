    "This is a small CTE high school with big dreams of helping students prepare for health careers not only in pharmacy, dentistry, and Diagnostic Medicine, but also in many other science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) areas. The focus on STEM helps students market their skills in the growing job industries. Our unique project-based instructional approach uses activities that engage students' interest and motivation as they solve problems using an inquiry approach. These activities are designed to answer a question or solve a problem and generally reflect the types of learning and work people do in the everyday world outside the classroom. We are part of the Career Readiness and Modern Youth Apprenticeship (CRMYA) pilot, which helps us support career readiness for all our students. We have courses that help our ninth and tenth graders explore their career interests and develop readiness skills. Our students can apply for apprenticeships in tech, finance, and business, which allows them to earn and learn while in high school.",
