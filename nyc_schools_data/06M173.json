    "The P.S. 173 Family graduates successful and caring citizens of the world. We engage immigrant students in the development of academic, linguistic and cross-cultural skills necessary for achievement in high school and beyond. We value academic strengths and social experiences our students bring to P.S. 173 and build upon them as we guide students to master the New York State core curriculum and life-long learning skills at the same time they are learning academic English. We recognize and promote active engagement of school staff, families and diverse communities in order to reach our goals. We offer reduced class sizes and multiple opportunities for success in our expanded learning programs that include a free three-hour after school academic and extracurricular program five days a week in our building, for all students in partnership with the Y & YMHA of Washington Heights/Inwood. Our 6th graders attend six entire operas at the New York Metropolitan Opera House as part of an opera class taught by our principal; our 7th graders spend three days and two nights in an Environmental Education Camp experience and our 8th graders benefit from a ten week ballroom dance residency program.",
