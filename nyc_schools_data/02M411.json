    "At Baruch College Campus High School (BCCHS),  every student receives a personalized education, supporting their growth and development. As a small, college preparatory high school, we focus on the development of strong community ties, academic rigor and a culture of social advocacy.  Incoming 9th grade students are supported in transitioning to high school with a senior mentor program and study skills course. As a small school, we expand our reach by partnering with organizations, providing partnerships in theater arts, dance, and computer science. We offer nine Advanced Placement courses and students complete two years of Visual Art in 9th and 10th grade. As part of our focus around community, our four-year Advisory program supports social emotional learning and restorative circles. Students are taught to think critically by completing a social action project in 10th grade and an independent research project in 12th grade. Our full time college counselor and college college readiness electives in 11th and 12th grade help us maintain our strong college placement rate.",
