    "Urban Assembly New York Harbor School focuses on marine science, marine technology, and marine policy. We believe in learning by doing. Students should expect to spend time outdoors in sites all over New York Harbor in all seasons. With our partners, including the Billion Oyster Project, we work to develop authentic activities on, around, and related to the water that create a sense of responsibility to New York Harbor and develop a new generation of maritime advocates, enthusiasts, workers, and decision-makers. New York Harbor School's location on Governors Island is easily accessible from Lower Manhattan via the Governors Island ferry.",
