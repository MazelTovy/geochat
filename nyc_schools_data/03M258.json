      "Community Action School is built on the belief that the entire school community must support the academic, social, and emotional growth of all students. Our collaborative teaching staff ensures that all students receive individualized support for high levels of academic growth. Our curriculum, aligned to the Common Core, challenges and engages our students. We are currently in the process of being certified as an International Baccalaureate (IB) school. The IB program is designed to develop well-rounded individuals who can respond to today's challenges with optimism and an open mind. It enables teachers to cultivate resilient, self-motivated young people with the knowledge, skills, and sense of purpose they need to thrive throughout their lives and contribute to making the world a better place. Our students enjoy frequent academic and cultural trips to complement lessons learned in the classroom, leveraging the rich resources of New York City as a learning tool. Two of our most popular trips are our three-day/two-night camping trip  to the Clearpool Environmental Education Center in upstate New York to build teamwork and community and our annual school-wide Broadway trip.  All 8th-grade students are enrolled in two Regents level classes": "Algebra 1 and Biology. We place a strong emphasis on transdisciplinary learning, encouraging students to explore topics from multiple perspectives across different subjects. Our advisory program focuses on student goal-setting and nurturing the social and emotional growth of our students. Parents value the way that administrators and instructors make themselves available to assist with any concerns. Our robust afterschool program includes sports, arts, and academic options, alongside a Saturday Academy program that runs from October thr"
