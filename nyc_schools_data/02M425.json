    "At the Leadership and Public Service High School, we believe that education is a portal to developing tomorrow's leaders. It is the school's mission to have families, students, administration, and staff collaborate to identify issues, define goals, and reach academic success. Our curriculum includes athletic, civic, and social programs, and connects learning to life beyond the classroom. We offer a strong 4 year advisory course which trains our students to be certified restorative justice practitioners. Advisory also allows our students to form close relationships with our faculty members. Our students learn through innovative teaching practices and access to various early college programs which help them develop a deeper understanding of themselves, others, and our world through our academic partnerships with the Syracuse University, Metropolitan College of New York, Touro College, and Borough of Manhattan Community College.",
