      "Lower Manhattan Community (LMC) is a small, rigorous middle school with a strong arts program that serves a diverse community.  During their three years of middle school we seek to challenge students to think creatively, solve challenges, and engage with peers to build connection and share ideas and experiences.  At LMC students take four arts courses": "Digital Arts, Dance, Music, and Visual Arts and have the opportunity engage with the art course to which they feel the greatest connection.  Every day our students begin in a small advisory group of 10-12 of their peers.  Led by one of their teachers, our advisory curriculum explores such topics as goal-setting, identity, values, service, and human rights.  Our advisories serve as a structure around which we plan the many field trips in which our students participate throughout the year, including overnight trips.  In advisory we also prepare students for the opportunity of \"out lunch\" for which students in good academic standing are eligible after the first trimester of 6th grade.  At LMC our robust after school program, developed in partnership with Manhattan Youth, build on our arts, academic, and advisory programs through daily programming that is free of charge."
