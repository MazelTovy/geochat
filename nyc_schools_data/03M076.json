    "Asa Philip Randolph strives for academic excellence for all students. Our teaching staff is a vibrant mix of new and experienced teachers from diverse backgrounds, all of whom are fully committed to the academic growth and well-being of their students. Additionally, the many cultural institutions of New York City are used to magnify students' learning experiences and allow them to explore the world around them. It creates an excitement about learning that pushes them to excel to their fullest potential. Parents appreciate our use of data to drive and differentiate the instruction to meet individual student needs. Students are challenged to explore their individual learning styles and set goals to help them become well rounded citizens and life-long learners. Throughout the year students in grade 6th-8th visit several colleges around New York and New Jersey. Students are provided with personal lockers and a Yondr bag to safely store their personal electronic devices. Students can choose to participate in student council or apply to become a Prefect, bringing student voice to the learning community.",
