      "MS 319's vision is guided by three main principles": "Persevere, Achieve, and Excel. Our school promotes a curriculum that leads to college-ready habits, providing students the skills and drive to achieve their goals. Sports, clubs, after school programs, trips, music, and the arts are an intrinsic part of our school day, allowing students to apply their academic learning in different ways. The ability to work in groups, think, research, and use technology daily promotes opportunities for students to become life-long learners. Our ability to support parents, offer English classes, and extended programs beyond the regular school day are possible because of our partnerships with local organizations."
