    "Welcome to PS/MS149 Sojourner Truth grades 3K to 8th. Respectfully known as Sotru, the school where, \"Leaders are Created to Change the World.\" Here at Sotru you will find staff that are devoted to making an impactful change in the lives of students and their families. A place where lessons and instruction go beyond the classroom to build on everyday experiences as it prepares students for a successful future. Our students are given the opportunity to engage in rigorous academics which enhances discourse and critical thinking. In addition to a strong academic framework, students are exposed to geographic areas outside of New York City. Students take annual trips to Washington D.C., the nation's capital, where they explore national monuments and museums. They venture out of the city to upstate New York, where they learn firsthand the sport of snowboarding and skiing.  To ensure success for our students and families we have partnered up with HCZ (Harlem Children's Zone) after school program. HCZ offers services that are aligned with our vision of creating future leaders. While taking part in the after-school program students participate in the art of dancing, conduct science fairs, learn exciting activities such as skateboarding, lacrosse, year-round basketball camp and much more.  Here at Sotru we also believe in the importance of social emotional health. Therefore, we have partnered up with the New York Foundling Mental Health Clinic. As a result of the partnership, New York Foundling has set up daily services in the school building to support the mental health of our school community. In addition to caring for students, we also support the needs of the families.  Our community partnerships have allowed us to establish a school store, a care closet as well as a laundr",
