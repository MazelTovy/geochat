    "Harvest Collegiate High School offers a rich and challenging intellectual education that engages students in the natural process of experience, questioning, the pursuit of precision, and reflection - the way people really learn. We believe in cultivating students' power to produce and reflect, rather than simply consume, as a fundamental way of being in the world. We aspire to being and contributing creatively to a 'sane society,' one of peace, growth, and joy. We believe all young people flourish in conditions that challenge and support. We prepare students for success in college and for participatory leadership that promotes values of active responsibility for mankind and our world. Our school offers many career-building opportunities through FutureReadyNYC Education pathway including college-credit courses with Professors, College Now partnerships, Internships and paid jobs through the school. Also, we will be offering AP Art and Design, AP Biology, AP English Literature, AP Macroeconomics, college-level Poetry and Public Policy with National Ed Equity Lab as well as other APs via virtual classrooms",
