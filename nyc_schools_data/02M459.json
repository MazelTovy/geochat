    "Manhattan International High School (MIHS) is a thriving, multicultural community where students from over 60 nationalities and speakers of 40 different languages come together. Specializing in serving recently immigrated students who are new learners of English, MIHS offers a supportive and dynamic learning environment. Our dedicated teachers collaborate to create engaging interdisciplinary curricula, ensuring students acquire the competency-based skills and knowledge necessary for success in both higher education and their future careers. Each student benefits from personalized attention with a counselor available for every 75 students. Our hands-on, project-based approach culminates in the presentation of Portfolios as a graduation requirement, fostering both linguistic and academic growth.    MIHS offers a robust Software Engineering Program, College Now & Advanced Placement (AP) classes, and extensive Work-Based Learning (WBL) opportunities. Recognized as an Apple Distinguished School, we are committed to integrating cutting-edge technology into education. As part of the Career Readiness and Modern Youth Apprenticeship (CRMYA) pilot and Future Ready NYC, we prepare our students for future careers by developing Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs in Education and Computer Science. Our ninth and tenth graders explore career interests and develop readiness skills through specialized courses. In 11th grade, students participate in internships through the WBL program, gaining valuable real-world experience. Students have the opportunity to apply for apprenticeships in tech, finance, and business, allowing them to earn and learn while in high school. Additionally, through the EdEquity program, our students can take college courses from prestigious institutions",
