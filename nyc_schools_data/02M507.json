    "The mission of the Urban Assembly Gateway School for Technology is to engage our students through inventive problem-solving that integrates technology with the habits of mind that prepare them for college and careers. Our students are prepared as creative and analytical producers of technology with an authoritative understanding of their role and influence in the digital age. Graduates will be both college and career-ready, prepared in Digital Design & Animation, Information Technology & Systems, or Software Engineering. Creative and connected teaching and learning with our award-winning staff takes place in a tech-rich environment with fully operational tech labs, and laptops. We are part of the Career Readiness and Modern Youth Apprenticeship (CRMYA) pilot, which helps us support career readiness for all our students. We have courses that help our ninth and tenth graders explore their career interests and develop readiness skills. Our students can apply for apprenticeships in tech, finance, and business, which allows them to earn and learn while in high school.",
