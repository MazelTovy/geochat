    "The Young Women's Leadership School of Manhattan (TYWLS) is the first in a national network of excellent all-girls college prep schools. Starting in 6th grade, TYWLS works to support the 'whole girl'  in order to maximize achievement and well-being. Our middle school is dedicated to creating a supportive and challenging environment, leveraging what we know about tween and teen girls' development to nurture positive self-image, effective communication, leadership behavior, and comfort with productive struggle. Our supportive school culture includes advisory, after-school academic tutoring, and regular contact with parents. Girls' Inc. provides after-school support, fun, and leadership opportunities.  Middle Schoolers are encouraged to engage in our school community, grabbing leadership opportunities to perform in whole-school events, exhibit their work for all the grades, and even create new school rituals and activities.  Most importantly, TYWLS middle schoolers have priority admission to  TYWLS' high-school program, where we have a full-time CollegeBound Initiative college counselor on staff to guide students and parents through the process of visiting and choosing colleges, applying to college, and applying for financial aid. TYWLS has maintained near perfect graduation and college acceptance rates since its inception in 1996, nurturing the intellectual curiosity and creativity of young women for thirty years.",
